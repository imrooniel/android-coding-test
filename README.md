Android Coding Test
===================
Thank you for taking our Android coding test.

Instructions
------------------
* Sign up for a GitHub account if you don't already have one.
* Fork this repository into your account.
* Clone it to your local machine.
* Spend no more than 2 hours working on the following tasks:

    1. Bug fix: the app crashes on loading the list of contacts from the API.
    2. New feature: Ability to view all the data about a given contact by tapping on a contact in the list view and opening a new contact details page.
    3. New feature: Ability to view contacts which share the hobbies of any contact I am viewing on the contact details page.
    4. New feature: Ability to tap on the "call" icon in the contact list to automatically phone the contact.
    5. New feature: Ability to tap on the "email" icon in the contact list to launch my preferred email, composing a new email to the contact.
    6. New feature: A new "close app" menu option visible on all tabs.

* Commit and push your work to your remote GitHub repository.
* Submit a pull request to us on GitHub for your changes.

Friendly Advice
------------------
* Use Android Studio.
* Make a series of small, logical commits, with good commit comments rather than one large commit for all your work.
* The contacts data which the app gets is hosted [here](http://www.mocky.io/v2/58e4f80f1100004e00bfc4b3).
* The project is using [Dagger 2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) for dependency injection and [Butterknife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) for binding views. Ideally you will use these as well. If however you've never used them, we'd advise completing the test with your choice of frameworks (or none at all) rather than trying to learn these during the test.
* If you are unsure of how best to implement the new features, use your best judgement to create a functional and usable app.
* If you have technical issues preventing you from completing the test, please let your recruiter know and we'll help.

Good luck.
